# PROYECTO2-GPC (Raytracing)

A ray tracing diorama inspired by the Cherry Blossom biome from Minecraft. The project combines serene aesthetics with technical rendering features such as lighting, reflections, and emissive materials, creating a visually immersive experience. It’s a small scene that captures the calm yet mysterious atmosphere of nature, enhanced by dynamic lighting and reflections.

## Features
- Dynamic 3D Rendering: The diorama uses ray tracing techniques to simulate realistic lighting, shadows, and reflections.
- Multiple Light Sources: The scene features day-night cycles and dynamic light sources like the sun, moon, and glowing materials such as glowstone.
- Fresnel Reflections: Realistic reflections on water surfaces that change based on the viewing angle, adding a touch of realism.
- Emissive Glowstone: The glowstone blocks emit light during the night, creating a warm and ambient atmosphere.
- Day and Night Cycle: The lighting dynamically changes based on the time of day, from bright daytime skies to the dark and mysterious night.
